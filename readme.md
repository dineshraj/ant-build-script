# A custom html5bp build script

The build script is a tool that optimizes your code for production use on the web.

It has been customised for use by me in my projects and so as the following configurations

* This should be placed in a subdirectory in html5bp (i.e. /source/build)
* The publsih folder has been set to /public

To build your project use the following commands:

    cd source/build
    ant build
